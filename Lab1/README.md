Results achieved through the solution discovered are as below:

for N = 5:  
Found a solution in 3 steps; visited 32 states  
path = [{0}, {0, 1, 3}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}]  
W = 9  

for N = 10:  
Found a solution in 3 steps; visited 776 states  
path = [{2, 5}, {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}]  
W = 17  

for N = 20:  
Found a solution in 4 steps; visited 15,887 states   
path = [{0, 1, 2, 7}, {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 16, 19}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}]
